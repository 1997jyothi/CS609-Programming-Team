# CS609 Programming Team Repository
You will use this repository for all of your group's programming work. 
There are two main directories in this repository:
  * __Programming__ - Here you will work together to explore various programming languages.
  * __Intepreter__ = This folder will house your group's term project, where you will create a new interpreted langauge.

# Assignment Submissions
Each group assignment will tell you the correct folder in which you are to place your work.
You will submit your assignments by adding your code to this repository. You will not have the 
option of handing in late work! I will simply grade whatever is in your respoistory at the appointed due date.

# Team Work Requirements
Every member of your group is required to make regular commits to the repository. You should commit and
push at least at the end of each work session. Each group member will be graded according to their contribution
statistics in github. This means that frequent pushes are a must! I will be looking at the percentage of the
code which is attributable to you. You are working in groups of 5, and so I expect each team member to be 
responsible for 20% of the code. Of course, it will be difficult to hit this mark exactly,
and so there will be a 10% leeway. The grade you will receive as an individual is computed according to the
following formula:

    group grade * multiplier

The multipliers are based on your percentage of contribution:
  * 0-5% : multiplier = 0
  * 5-10% : multiplier = 0.5
  * 10-30% : multiplier = 1
  * 30- 50% : multiplier = 0.75
  * 50 - 75% : multiplier = 0.5
  * greater than 75%: multiplier = 0
The keen observer will note that contributing too much will also result in a penalty. This means that you must 
find a way to share the responsibility equally. You do not have the option to fail to work together!
